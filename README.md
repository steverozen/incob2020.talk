## Mutational signatures: What caused the mutations in these cancers? Why do we care?

Mutational signature analysis looks for patterns of somatic mutations with the ultimate aim of deducing what caused the mutations. Mutational signatures are important for understanding DNA damage and repair, for understanding the cellular origins of cancer, for detecting mutagenic exposures that cause cancer, and for preventing and treating cancer. Aristolochic acid, a mutagen found naturally in herbs that are widely used as medicine, is a straightforward example. In the last 7 years, mutational signatures have implicated aristolochic acid as a common cause of liver, urinary tract, and oesophageal cancers. More involved analyses require machine learning, which can infer mutational signatures from the mutations in large numbers of cancers. Multiple approaches for this have been developed, but the process still requires substantial human guidance and interpretation. Furthermore, existing approaches are poorly-suited to answering common questions, such as “Does this set of tumours contain any novel mutational signatures?” and “What is the evidence that a particular signature is present in a given tumor?” I will propose some new computational approaches to answering these questions.
